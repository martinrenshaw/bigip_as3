## To Do

Work on the git merge from dev to master - process.

Add more of the var lookups into the templates.

## What if

What if I have a vip/pool etc already configured on the BIGIP can you change it via automation and if yes can you then revert it back?

What if I have a VIP called web-vip-01 with the IP 10.0.0.1/32 and the automation changes the ip address to 10.1.1.2/32, can it then be backed out and reverted too 10.1.1.1/32?

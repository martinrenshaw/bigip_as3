{# 
There is a virtual server named serviceMain.
The template can use variables just like tasks do in previous exercises. In this case the virtual IP address is the private_ip from our inventory.
There is a Pool named app_pool
The jinja2 template can use a loop to grab all the pool members (which points to our web servers group that will be elaborated on below).
